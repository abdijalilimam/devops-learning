password3:MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx

level 3:

then used "cat" to view the content inside 
password4:2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

level 4: 

used 'ls' to view
then used "cd" to navigate
then used "cat" to check each file
password5:4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

level 5: 

used "ls" to view 
then used "file ./*" to see file type 
in the same line i used "-size 1033c" to see the 1033 bytes 
then used ! to excluded other files and used "-executable" 
to see if the file is executable.
full command "file ./* -size 1033c ! -executable"
password6:HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

level 6: 

used "cd .." to navigate to the root 
ran " find -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c"
that showed permission denied then i found out i had to add 2>dev/null to supress out
to see through it then i use "cat" to view it
password7:morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

level 7: 

used "tail data.txt" to see the last 10 lines that did not work
used "head data.txt" to see the first 10 lines that did not work
used "grep millionth data.txt"
password8:dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

level 8: 

used "sort" in the begining of the file 
then used "|" to put stdout of the command in to the stdin of a the new command
password9:4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM

level 9: 

used "vim" to see the content of the file i was unable to read it 
then used the command "strings" to see if it is human readable
then used '|' to filter through the output or stdout
then used the "grep" command to find excatly == which the password was next to

level 10: 

used "man" to learn more about "base64"
used "based64" coupled with "-d" to decode the data.txt
full command was "base64 -d data.txt"
password11:dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr

level 11: 

used "cat" to read the text inside the file 
then used "|" to pass it throught the stdout to stdin of "tr"
"tr" is used to translate/decode strings since the file was encoded with rot13
rot13 moves 1st possition aphabet to the 13th places
so to decode that you will say every capital A - Z and small leter a-z  "A-Za-z"
 "N-ZA-Mn-za-m" place it 13th positon which is N - A and A - Z and do the same for the lowercase letter 
password12:7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4

level 12: 

step one is to create a directory in the working direcotory under /tmp usking "mkdir"
then copy the file data.txt using "cp"
use "xxd" for reversing the data type on the file 
use "xxd -r" to reverse the file back to binary format.
then dump it in to another file like "data"
use "mv" to change the file extentions before decopressing it 
because some decompressing tools like gzip expect a .gz file extension.
used "mv" to chnage file to .gz 
used "gzip -d" to decompress
then used "file" to check the file type
used "mv" to chnage file to .bz2
used "bzip2 -d" to decompress it even more
then used "file" to check the file type
used "mv" to chnage file to .gz 
used "gzip -d" to decompress
then used "file" to check the file type
then it was "POSIX tar archive"
used "tr xf" to extract it after using "mv" to chnage the file type
