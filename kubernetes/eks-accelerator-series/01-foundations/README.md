# Episode 1: Foundations & Local Dev

## Why this episode

We just finished the ECS Accelerator Series. The next jump is not "ECS but with `kubectl`". The next part is running the same thing we have done on Kubernetes. Hence, the EKS series. 

This episode is an orientation. 

## What you walk out with

- A mental map of the nine services and how they talk
- The order flow running locally via `docker compose`
- A local `kind` cluster with Pod, Deployment, Service and StatefulSet primitives running against real PVCs
- A reading list for the Go code so you can come into Episode 2 already knowing where state lives

## The project in one paragraph

Nine Go services. One Postgres. One Redis. One SQS queue with a DLQ. A worker that consumes events. A dashboard that drives the UI. You build the infrastructure, the manifests, the pipelines and the observability around it. Postgres and Redis run in the cluster on PVCs. This is the interesting part of the project. The applications are deliberately rough so you focus on the platform, not the code.

Full brief: [project.md](../project.md).

## Prerequisites

You need: Docker (with Compose v2), `kubectl`, `kind`, `jq`, `curl`, and optionally Go 1.26+. No AWS account needed for this episode.

macOS: `brew install --cask orbstack && brew install kubectl kind jq go`

Linux: see the [kind install docs](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) and use your package manager for the rest.

Then clone the repo and set `REPO_ROOT` so the `cd` lines below resolve:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderCo-Learning/eks-accelerator-series.git
cd eks-accelerator-series && REPO_ROOT=$(pwd)
```

## 1. Where Kubernetes fits

You already know:

- **Docker** runs the process
- **ECS** runs the container with AWS managing the scheduler

Kubernetes answers the same question as ECS, with more primitives and more rope.

| ECS thing | Kubernetes thing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Task | Pod | A pod can hold more than one container. Most don't |
| Task definition | PodSpec inside a Deployment / StatefulSet | Image, env, ports, resources, probes |
| Service | Deployment + Service | Deployment manages replicas. Service gives them a stable name |
| Service (Fargate) | Pod scheduled by the scheduler onto a node | EKS still has a scheduler, you can see it |
| ALB + target group | Ingress + Ingress Controller (Traefik) | Or Gateway API. Same idea, more layers |
| Task IAM role | ServiceAccount + IRSA | IAM trust is bound to a service account, not a task |
| Secrets in SSM | Secrets Manager via External Secrets | Secrets live in Secrets Manager, sync into K8s Secrets |
| Auto Scaling | HPA (and Karpenter for nodes) | Two scalers. Pods scale on metrics. Nodes scale on pending pods |
| CloudWatch Logs | Cluster logging stack | Promtail or Fluent Bit shipping to Loki or CloudWatch |

New things you did not have in ECS:

- **Namespace.** A soft tenant boundary. Not a security boundary on its own
- **StatefulSet.** A Deployment with stable identity and stable storage per pod
- **PersistentVolumeClaim.** A request for a disk. The cluster gives you one or fails to schedule
- **CustomResourceDefinition.** New API kinds. ArgoCD's `Application`, External Secrets' `ExternalSecret`, Karpenter's `NodePool` are all CRDs
- **Controllers.** Reconciliation loops that drive real state towards desired state. ArgoCD, Karpenter, cert-manager, External Secrets are all controllers

Read those last two more than once. Most of EKS work is configuring controllers.

## 2. Why we run Postgres and Redis in cluster

The project rules say RDS and ElastiCache are off the table. There is a reason.

Most teams put state on managed services because state on Kubernetes is the hard part. You get to do the hard part on purpose. We will go through things like in the future:

- Why a StatefulSet keeps `postgres-0` bound to the same PVC forever
- What happens to a PVC when the pod's AZ goes down
- How to take a snapshot and restore into a new PVC
- How a single pod restart looks to nine services that all hold open database connections

This is the bit that pays off in a real on call rotation. ECS hides most of it.

## 3. The nine services

Read the source before the next session. Code is in `services/` in the EKS v2 project repo.

| Service | Reads | Writes | Talks to |
|---|---|---|---|
| api-gateway | nothing | nothing (auth state in Redis) | order, inventory, payment, shipping, notification, dashboard |
| order-service | Postgres `orders` | Postgres `orders` | inventory, payment, SQS |
| inventory-service | Postgres `inventory` | Postgres `inventory` | Redis (locks) |
| payment-service | Postgres `payments` | Postgres `payments` | external gateway, SQS |
| notification-service | nothing | nothing | SMTP, SMS provider |
| shipping-service | Postgres `shipments` | Postgres `shipments` | carrier API, SQS |
| worker | SQS messages | Postgres (cross service) | order, payment, shipping, notification |
| scheduler | Postgres | Postgres + SQS | order, inventory, payment |
| dashboard-api | Postgres (read mostly) | Postgres | all of the above |

Things to look for while reading:

- Where does each service read its config from? (env vars vs files vs Secrets Manager)
- What port does it expose? Does it expose `/healthz`, `/livez` or `/metrics`?
- Where is the SQS publishing code? Which services emit events?
- Where does the worker decide an event has failed three times?
- Which service owns each table? Does anyone read another service's table?

That last question is the one that determines how you handle migrations later.

## 4. Local dev

Run the platform on your laptop before touching AWS. If you haven't installed the tools yet, jump back to [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

### Run the project locally

A snapshot of the application code lives in [`platform/`](../platform/README.md) at the root of this repo.

```bash
cd "$REPO_ROOT/platform"
docker compose up --build
```

What this brings up:

- All nine services with the deliberately naive `Dockerfile` in each service folder. 
- One Postgres
- One Redis
- LocalStack acting as SQS

> The SQS publish path and the worker consume loop are stubs in the upstream `eks-v2` source. We wire them up later in the series. For EP1 we just need the services to start and the synchronous order create to work.

### Smoke test

```bash
# api-gateway liveness (no auth)
curl http://localhost:8080/livez                  # HTTP 200, empty body
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz                # HTTP 200, {"service":"api-gateway","status":"ok"}

# register a user and grab the JWT
TOKEN=$(curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/register \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"test@coderco.io","password":"abc123"}' | jq -r .token)

# place an order through the gateway
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"items":[{"product_id":"sku-001","quantity":2,"price":9.99}],"currency":"USD"}'
# {"id":1,"status":"pending","total":19.98}

# the order-service logs the event it would send
docker compose logs --tail=20 order-service | grep 'Event -> SQS'
```

The dashboard UI is at <http://localhost:8086/>. Open it and click around once you have data in the database.

### Map the call graph

Open the compose logs across services (`docker compose logs --tail=0 -f` in one terminal). Place an order. Note the order of log lines. That is the synchronous call graph. The async paths (SQS, worker fan out) light up later in the series when you replace the stubs.

## 5. Lab: a kind cluster and four primitives

Goal: see Pod, Deployment, Service and StatefulSet behave with your own eyes on a local cluster. No EKS yet.

The manifests are in [`lab/`](lab). They are intentionally tiny. The point is the behaviour, not the YAML.

```bash
cd "$REPO_ROOT/01-foundations/lab"
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml --name eks-accel

# workers take a few seconds after `kind` returns; wait for Ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready node --all --timeout=120s
kubectl get nodes
# NAME                       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
# eks-accel-control-plane    Ready    control-plane    30s   v1.31.0
# eks-accel-worker           Ready    <none>           15s   v1.31.0
# eks-accel-worker2          Ready    <none>           15s   v1.31.0
```

### Run through the lab steps

The lab README walks each one. Short version:

```bash
# 1. A bare Pod (you almost never run these in real life)
kubectl apply -f 01-pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pod nginx                  # gone, not coming back

# 2. A Deployment (replicas + self healing)
kubectl apply -f 02-deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods
POD=$(kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -o name | head -1)
kubectl delete "$POD"                     # watch a new pod take its place

# 3. A Service in front of the Deployment
kubectl apply -f 03-service.yaml
kubectl port-forward svc/nginx 8080:80
curl localhost:8080

# 4. A StatefulSet with a PVC per pod
kubectl apply -f 04-statefulset.yaml
kubectl get pvc
kubectl exec data-0 -- sh -c 'echo hi > /data/hello; cat /data/hello'
kubectl delete pod data-0                 # comes back with the same PVC, same file
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/data-0 --timeout=60s
kubectl exec data-0 -- cat /data/hello
```

The point of step 4 is the moment the file survives a pod delete. Sit with that for a minute. That is the whole reason StatefulSets exist.

### Teardown

```bash
kind delete cluster --name eks-accel
```

Don't skip this. `kind` is local but it eats RAM.

## 6. Common confusions to flush before next week

- **A Pod is not a unit of scale.** A Deployment is. You scale Deployments, not Pods directly
- **A Service is not a load balancer.** It is a stable DNS name with iptables magic behind it. The load balancer is the Ingress (or Service of type LoadBalancer, which you mostly will not use)
- **`kubectl apply` is declarative, not imperative.** Re running it does not re create. It diffs and converges
- **The control plane runs the cluster. The data plane runs your work.** EKS manages the control plane. Karpenter manages your data plane

If any of those still feel hand wavy, that is the work for this week.

---

## Homework

1. Run the project locally end to end. Place five orders. Read the worker logs
2. Draw the call graph. Push it as `docs/architecture-v0.png` in your project repo
3. Read at least three of the Go services in full. Pick `order-service`, `worker` and one of your choice
4. Finish the kind lab. Delete `data-0` from the StatefulSet. Confirm the file you wrote survives
5. Write a paragraph in your project README about why this project keeps Postgres in cluster. Use your own words

Bring questions to the next session.
